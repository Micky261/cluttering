# Clutter for Pico

My notetaking theme for Pico CMS. Shamelessly ripped off from ['Bits and Pieces' by lostkeys](https://github.com/lostkeys/Bits-and-Pieces-Theme-for-Pico). I didn't copy any code, though - I had just been taking Markdown notes for a long time, and when I found Bits and Pieces, I thought it was a great idea. I decided to remake it my way as a fun exercise, and added my own features in the process.
